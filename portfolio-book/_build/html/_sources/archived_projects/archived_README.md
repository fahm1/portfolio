<h2 align="center">Project 1: <a href="https://github.com/fahm1/Portfolio/tree/main/Troll%20Tweet%20Analysis">Troll Tweet Analysis</a></h2>
In this project, we will analyze Russian troll tweet data from the dataset provided by <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets/">fivethirtyeight</a>.  
Some analysis of this data has already been <a href="http://pwarren.people.clemson.edu/Linvill_Warren_TrollFactory.pdf">completed and published</a> by Linvill and Warren of Clemson university.

</br>

In this analysis, we will be trying to answer one primary question:  
**What characteristics of troll accounts and their tweets make them successful?**

In this case, we are equating success to the number of followers the troll account has, as a higher follower account will allow the troll to spread their message to a greater number of individuals. 

As we answer this question, we will be answering some secondary questions that will help guide our answer, such as:
* Which account category is most successful?
* What are some specific characteristics of the most successful account category?
* What type of language are the top troll accounts using?

<a name="Project-2"></a>
<h2 align="center">Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/fahm1/Portfolio/tree/main/Absenteeism%20Analysis">Absenteeism at Work Analysis</a></h2>
In this project, we will analyze the absenteeism data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [found here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work).

The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil.  

We will define absenteeism as follows:  
* absence from work during normal working hours resulting in temporary incapacity to execute regular working activity

In this analysis, we will be trying to answer one primary question:  
**Which factors are most indicative of excessive absenteeism from work and can we predict absenteeism by identifying these factors?**

While answering this question, we will also be making use of logistic regression in order to create a model which can predict absenteeism. 

By answering this question and creating our model, we will be able to predict the absenteeism rate for any given employee, which will help us maximize the quantity and quality of work done. 

Some visualizations shown will be created using Tableau.

<h2 align="center">Project 3: <a href="https://github.com/fahm1/Portfolio/tree/main/Movie%20Analysis">Movie Media Analysis</a></h2>
In this project, we will analyze movie data, specifically the film media (e.g. film vs. digital), the genre, and the budget.

In doing so, we will be trying to answer the following questions:
* How has the distribution of film media changed over time? 
* How has the distribution of genres changed over time?
* Does movie genre dictate film media?
* What are the distributions of budgets of each film media?

<a name="Project-4"></a>
<h2 align="center">Project 4: <a href="https://github.com/fahm1/Portfolio/tree/main/Microbe%20Analysis">Microbe Data Analysis</a></h2>
Data is adapted from the publicly available data for the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/14/6477">2010 Fierer et al. paper</a>.

In this project, we will analyze bacterial phyla that were found on keyboard keys as well as on finger tips. We will also take a look at this data on an individual basis. 

In doing so, we will be trying to answer the following questions:   
* Are some bacterial phyla highly correlated to another bacterial phyla?
* Do bacterial communities found on keyboard keys and fingertips differ on an individual basis?
* Is there a correlation between bacteria found on keyboard keys and on finger tips?
