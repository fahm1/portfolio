# Russian Troll Tweet Analysis

In this project, we will analyze Russian troll tweet data from the dataset provided by [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets/).  
[Some analysis](http://pwarren.people.clemson.edu/Linvill_Warren_TrollFactory.pdf) of this data has already been completed and published by Linvill and Warren of Clemson university.

In this analysis, we will be trying to answer one primary question:  
**What characteristics of troll accounts and their tweets make them successful?**

In this case, we are equating success to the number of followers the troll account has, as a higher follower account will allow the troll to spread their message to a greater number of individuals. 

As we answer this question, we will be answering some secondary questions that will help guide our answer, such as:
* Which account category is most successful?
* What are some specific characteristics of the most successful account category?
* What type of language are the top troll accounts using?
